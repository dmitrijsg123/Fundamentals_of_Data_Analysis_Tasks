Python to take a list as input and to return a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. I am using my own golf scorecard as a list of results on each hole.

Step 2  - create an empty dictionary

Step 3 - iterate a for loop with a list of 18 values

Step 5 - use a get() function

Step 6 - return count
