# Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis_Tasks

Task 1
Python to take a list as input and to return a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. I am using my own golf scorecard as a list of results on each hole.

Step 1 - define a function named Counts

Step 2  - create an empty dictionary

Step 3 - iterate a for loop with a list of 18 values

Step 5 - use a get() function

Step 6 - return count

Step 7 - driver function

Step 8 - print final output


Task 3
<b>Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve.</b><br><br>

Step 1 - Plotting with random.binomial() function from numpy.random package.
Step 2 - Writing a code that would simulate flipping a coin 100 times.
Step 3 - Writing a code that runs the simulation 1000 times.
Step 5 - Plotting the results on a bar plot and curved line plot.
Step 6 - Conclusion.

Task 4<br>
<b> Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. You might create your x arrays using numpy.linspace and create the y array for each x using notation like y = a * x + b where you choose the a and b for each x , y pair to demonstrate the paradox. You might see the Wikipedia page for Simpson’s paradox for inspiration.  </b><br>
<br>
Step 1 - Real-life example of the Simpson's Paradox.<br>
Step 2 - Creating datasets for 2 basketball players for 2 seasons:<br>
   Player A season 1<br>
   Player B season 1<br>
   Player A season 2<br>
   Player B season 2.<br>
Step 3 - Extracting necessary data from 4 datasets and combining them into new dataset.<br>
Step 4 - Conclusion<br>
Step 5 - Disclamer
